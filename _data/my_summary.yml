summary: I am currently a Research Officer at the Baker Institute (since January 2019) in the Systems Genomics lab, under the supervision of professors Mike Inouye and Agus Salim. My research interests are broad and involve mainly the relationship between genetic variants and their effect on protein structures.<br>
I carried out my MSc and PhD in Barcelona (<a href="http://www.ub.edu/bl">Barril Lab</a>), where I worked with different structure-based drug design methods with the aim to improve drug design for non-standard targets.
